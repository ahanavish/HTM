<h1>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
- Often we are forced to buy an entire pack of medicines even if it is more than our prescribed dose and the extra medicines go to waste.
<br/>- It takes a lot of effort, revenue and resources to manufacture medicines and there are people who are unable to even afford them.

<br/>
<h1>SOLUTION</h1>
- We aim to connect those in need of medicines with the ones who have them in excess. 
<br/>- Build an app which let's users put up an advertisement for unused medicines and buy from the available stock. 
<br/>- Medicines being a sensitive product, we would be including some strict restrictions on the medicines being onboarded. 
<br/>- We would also be focusing on making the onboarding process as smooth as possible by making effective use of Computer Vision technologies to identify the medicine, and its details. 

<br/>
<h1> FUTURE SCOPE</h1>
- A chat feature to enable communication between the seller and buyer would also be provided. 
<br/>- Gamification and Prize System to encourage people from selling their ununsed medicines.
</br>- Partnership with NGOs for donation of medicines to needy people.
</br>- Tie up with Companies for validation of companies. 
<br/>- In order to make the process of buying medicines smooth we would be providing best results by sorting the medicines in stock in increasing order of distance, cost, expiry date.
